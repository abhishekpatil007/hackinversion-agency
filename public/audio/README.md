# Audio Files for Testimonials Component

This directory should contain the following audio files for the typewriter testimonials component:

- `audio_1.mp3` - Testimonial from Alex Chen
- `audio_2.mp3` - Testimonial from Sarah Johnson  
- `audio_3.mp3` - Testimonial from Michael Rodriguez
- `audio_4.mp3` - Testimonial from Emily Zhang
- `audio_5.mp3` - Testimonial from David Kim
- `audio_6.mp3` - Testimonial from Lisa Thompson
- `audio_7.mp3` - Testimonial from Robert Wilson
- `audio_8.mp3` - Testimonial from Jennifer Park

## Audio Requirements:
- Format: MP3
- Duration: 10-30 seconds each
- Quality: 128kbps or higher
- Content: Should match the testimonial text exactly

## Note:
The component will gracefully handle missing audio files by showing a console warning and continuing with the typewriter effect only.

## Alternative:
If you don't have actual audio files, you can:
1. Use text-to-speech services to generate audio from the testimonial text
2. Record short audio clips of people reading the testimonials
3. Use placeholder audio files for testing
4. Remove the audio functionality by modifying the component
